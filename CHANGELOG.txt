31 Oct 2025 - initial version
01 Nov 2025 - Added LLVM-style RTTI to AST (Node/NodeKind, isa/dyn_cast), introduced SemanticAnalyzer with scope
              tracking, type checks, and strict GOTO/GOSUB validation (now default), enabled string-to-string
              comparisons (codegen via strcmp), refactored codegen/optimizer away from dynamic_cast, integrated
              semantics into the compile pipeline (CodeGenerator::setSemantics), updated tests/README/CMake; all
              builds and tests passing.
01 Nov 2025 - Added targeted file-stream lexer tests (std::ifstream) that write under build/tmp to cover
              Lexer(std::istream&) directly; confirmed main() and compileFile*/phase-log paths use stream-based
              lexing. Strengthened semantic analysis with IF target validation, numeric-only FOR start/end/step,
              and duplicate line number detection; added unit tests for each. Verified 'make clean lint test build
              demo' complete successfully.
01 Nov 2025 - Added math function calls to expressions:
              - Introduced CallExpr AST and parsing of identifier(...) with comma-separated args.
              - Implemented numeric functions SQR (sqrt) and ABS with semantic checks (unary, numeric-only).
              - Codegen now declares and emits calls to @sqrt and @fabs; added -lm when linking on non-Apple.
              - Unit tests cover codegen emission and semantic arity/type errors.
