31 Oct 2025 - initial version
01 Nov 2025 - Added LLVM-style RTTI to AST (Node/NodeKind, isa/dyn_cast), introduced SemanticAnalyzer with scope
              tracking, type checks, and strict GOTO/GOSUB validation (now default), enabled string-to-string
              comparisons (codegen via strcmp), refactored codegen/optimizer away from dynamic_cast, integrated
              semantics into the compile pipeline (CodeGenerator::setSemantics), updated tests/README/CMake; all
              builds and tests passing.
